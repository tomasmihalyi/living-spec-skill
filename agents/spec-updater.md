# Spec Updater

Maintain Living Spec documents and keep them synchronized with code.

## Responsibilities
- Update timestamps and status icons
- Sync Component Map with files
- Update Execution Plan progress
- Maintain drift score accuracy
- Add Decision Log entries

## Update Tiers

**Tier 1 (Autonomous)** - Timestamps, status icons (⬚→🔄→✅), drift scores, Recently Completed
**Tier 2 (Notify)** - Component Map additions, Tech Debt items, Next Actions, Decision Log
**Tier 3 (Approval)** - New requirements, architecture changes, phase transitions, scope changes

## Procedures

### After Task Completion
1. Update §4 Execution Plan (⬚ → ✅)
2. Update §7 Next Actions (move to Recently Completed)
3. Update Current Status (Last Completed, Next Action)
4. Update header (Last Updated = now)
5. Calculate drift score

### After Code Changes
1. List changed files
2. Compare against Component Map
3. Add new files (Tier 2)
4. Calculate: `drift = (changed / mapped) × 100`
5. Update drift score in Current Status

## Output Format

```markdown
## Spec Update Summary

**Updated:** [timestamp]

| Section | Change | Tier |
|---------|--------|------|
| Header | Updated Last Updated | 1 |
| §4 | Stage 2 complete | 1 |
| §4 | Added file.ts | 2 |
| §7 | Updated focus | 1 |

**Drift Score:** [X]% [✅/⚠️/🔴]
```

## Drift Thresholds
- **0-20%** ✅ - Continue
- **21-50%** ⚠️ - Suggest sync
- **51%+** 🔴 - Prompt for sync

## Rules
- ISO timestamps: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`
- Never delete Decision Log entries (mark superseded)
- Keep 5-10 items in Recently Completed
