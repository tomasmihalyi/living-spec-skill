## Tech Debt Analysis

When architect reviews tech debt:

```
⚠️ TECHNICAL DEBT ANALYSIS

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DEBT SUMMARY

| Severity | Count | Trend |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 🔴 High | [X] | [↑/↓/→] |
| ⚠️ Medium | [Y] | [↑/↓/→] |
| 📝 Low | [Z] | [↑/↓/→] |

Total: [X+Y+Z] items

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HIGH SEVERITY ITEMS

TD-001: [Title]
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Description: [What the debt is]         │
│ Location: [Component/files]             │
│ Impact: [What problems it causes]       │
│ Trigger: [When to address]              │
│ Effort to fix: [Estimate]               │
│ Created: [Date]                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

TD-002: [Title]
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Description: [What the debt is]         │
│ ...                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DEBT BY COMPONENT

| Component | High | Medium | Low |
|-----------|------|--------|-----|
| [Component] | [X] | [Y] | [Z] |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Address TD-001 before [milestone/phase]
2. Consider TD-003 during next refactor
3. TD-005 can be deferred to post-launch

Would you like to:
A) Update debt item status
B) Add new debt item
C) Create debt reduction plan
```

## Component Relationship View

When architect explores component relationships:

```
🔗 COMPONENT RELATIONSHIPS

[Component A]
    │
    ├──→ [Component B] (dependency)
    │         │
    │         └──→ [Component C]
    │
    └──→ [Component D] (shared)
              │
              └──→ [External Service]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DEPENDENCY MATRIX

| Component | Depends On | Depended By |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| A | - | B, D |
| B | A | C |
| C | B | - |
| D | A | External |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

COUPLING ANALYSIS

| Relationship | Coupling | Notes |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| A → B | Tight | Consider interface |
| B → C | Loose | Good |
| D → External | API | Has fallback |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS

1. [Suggestion based on analysis]
2. [Another suggestion]

## Red Flags for Architects

| Flag | Condition | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 🔴 Unapproved decisions | Decisions pending >5 days | Review and approve |
| ⚠️ High tech debt | >5 high severity items | Plan debt reduction |
| 🔴 Missing decisions | Implementation without decision | Document retroactively |
| ⚠️ Circular deps | Components have circular dependencies | Refactor |
| 🔴 No rationale | Decision without documented rationale | Add rationale |
